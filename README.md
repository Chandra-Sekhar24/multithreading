# Multithreaded Data Processing Application

## Overview

This C program is a multithreaded application designed for real-time data processing from multiple sources. It utilizes pthreads for thread management, mutex for synchronization, and includes basic error handling.

## Compilation and Execution

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler and pthread library installed on your system.

### Compilation

bash
gcc -o multithreaded_data_processing multithreaded_data_processing.c -pthread


### Execution

bash
./multithreaded_data_processing


## Design Choices

### Thread Creation

Two threads are created to process data concurrently. The POSIX threads library (`pthread`) is used for managing threads.

### Data Processing

Simulated data processing is performed in the `processData` function. The program processes data from multiple sources concurrently in separate threads.

### Synchronization

A mutex is employed to ensure data integrity during concurrent processing. Critical sections are protected by locking and unlocking the mutex.

### Error Handling

Basic error handling is implemented for thread creation and joining processes. Error messages are printed to stderr.

## Report

### Design Choices

- **Thread Creation:** Utilized POSIX threads for creating concurrent threads to process data efficiently.

- **Data Processing:** Implemented a simple `processData` function to simulate data processing. This can be replaced with actual data processing logic.

- **Synchronization:** Employed a mutex to avoid race conditions and ensure data integrity during concurrent execution.

- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included to gracefully handle thread creation and joining failures.

### Synchronization Mechanisms

Mutexes are used for synchronization. The mutex ensures that only one thread can access critical sections at a time, preventing data corruption.

### Performance Considerations

The program aims for simplicity and clarity in this example. Performance optimizations will depend on the specific data processing requirements. Profiling tools can be used to identify bottlenecks and further optimize the code.
